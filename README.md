LSN exercise delivery by Edoardo Draetta. All data necessary for the notebooks is safely stowed away in the `data` directories. 

### Exercise 1 - Introduction

Use the `makefile` to create `main.exe`, which executes all simulations.

### Exercise 2 - Importance Sampling and Random Walks

Same as above.

### Exercise 3 - Options Pricing with GBM

Same as above.

### Exercise 4 - NVE Molecular Dynamics of Argon.

Use the `makefile` to create `MolDyn_NVE.exe`, which executes the simulation.

Inside the `data` directory I've left the parameters and starting configurations for each phase.

### Exercise 5 - Sampling QM Wavefunctions with Metropolis

Use the `makefile` to create `Metro.exe`, which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 6 - The 1D Ising Model with Metropolis and Gibbs

Use the `makefile` to create `Monte_Carlo_Ising_1D.exe`, which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 7 - Monte Carlo NVT

Use the `makefile` to create `Monte_Carlo_NVT.exe`, which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 8 - Variational Monte Carlo and PIGS

Use the `makefile` to create `Variational_MC.exe`, which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 9 - Traveling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithm

Use the `makefile` to create `TSP.exe`, which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 10 - TSP with Simulated Annealing and Parallel Genetic Algorithm

Use the `makefile` to create `TSP.exe` within each subfolder (parallel, genetic, annealing), which executes the simulation.

### Exercise 11 - Introduction to Keras

Notebook.

### Exercise 12 - Digit Recognition with Keras

Notebook.
