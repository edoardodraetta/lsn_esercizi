### Exercise 5

Show a picture of your estimations of the expectation value of `r` in the ground state and in the excited state along with their uncertainties with a large number of throws (M>= 10e6) as a function of the number of blocks, N.

- [x] proof of concept
- [x] compute <r> in one block
- [x] compute <r> in multiple blocks
- [x] excited state
- [x] gaussian transition probability
